    "review": "চুইঝাল, দক্ষিণবাংলার ঐতিহ্যবাহী মশলার এক অনন্য দান, স্বাদ ও ঘ্রাণের অদ্ভুত মেলবন্ধনে বাঙালির মন জয় করেছে। চুইঝালের স্বাদে মন ভরে, ঘ্রাণে দেহ জুড়ে—এই কথার মতোই, এর ঝাঁঝালো স্বাদ খাবারে আনে অপূর্ব এক মাত্রা, আর এর ঘ্রাণ সজীবতার পরশ ছড়িয়ে দেয় দেহ-মনে। রাঁধুনিদের হাত ধরে চুইঝালের এই মহিমা যখন রান্নায় প্রকাশ পায়, তখন প্রতিটি লোকমায় অনুভব করা যায় বাঙালির ঐতিহ্যের সুর। তাই, যারা শুধু খাওয়া নয় বরং এক স্বাদের ভ্রমণে যেতে চান, তাদের জন্য চুইঝাল সত্যিকারের এক আনন্দের উৎস।",
